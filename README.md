**:warning: Warning! The author is not responsible for any damages related to the use of this integration. You use this integration at your own risk and responsibility.**

## Installation

Before installing this integration, you must have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) integration installed first.
Select 'HACS' (usual on the left bar), add then choose from menu 'Custom repositories' (on top at right). Put the address https://github.com/derekpurdy/BM7 at first and select repository type 'Integration' choose 'ADD'. Now you can add BM7 devices.

## Configuration

Go to "Settings', next 'Devices & services', select 'Integration' and use 'ADD INTEGRATION'

In the configuration process, you need to provide some information. This includes the battery voltage, type, method of calculating its condition or percentage. You can also specify the intervals at which data should be downloaded from the BM7 device. You can also correct the temperature and voltage provided by the BM7 device by providing their offset. It is also possible to change the temperature unit.

### Battery States and Percentage

#### Algorithms of battery status

To calculate percentage of battery power and actual state, integration use algorithm configured by user.

- Calculated by BM7 Device (integration get information from BM7 device)
- Calculated using State of Charge/Discharge (SoC/SoD)
- Calculated using Charge/Discharge Voltage Range (CVR/DVR)

#### States of battery

Each BM7 device have one calculated sensor presents actual battery state. It can take one of these values. Availability of this states is depending of used algorithms.

| State name    | From BM7 | Calculated | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|:--------:|:----------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ok            |    X     |            | Battery state Ok (1)                                                        |
| Low Voltage   |    X     |            | Low voltage (1)                                                             |
| Under Voltage |          |     X      | Voltage is under minimum of SoD or DVR                                      |
| Discharging   |          |     X      | Charging process, voltage is between minimum and maximum of SoD or DVR      |
| Idle          |          |     X      | Idle state, voltage is between maximum SoD or DVR and minimum of SoC or CVR |
| Charging      |    X     |     X      | Charging process, voltage is between minimum and maximum of SoC or CVR      |
| Over Voltage  |          |     X      | Voltage is over maximum of SoC or CVR                                       |
 (1) - Only the BM7 manufacturer knows the details

## Integration Sensors

- Sensor 'Temperature' it presents temperature measure by BM7 device. Value can by calibrated at integration configuration time.
- Sensor 'Voltage' it presents battery voltage measure by BM7 device. Value can by calibrated too.
- Sensor 'State' calculates the hypothetical battery state from the actual device voltage. Calculation can use parameters of battery configuration or can be get directly from BM7 device.
- Sensor 'Percent' calculates the hypothetical charge or discharge percentage of the battery using one of these algorithms

## Diagnostic Sensors

- Sensor 'Signal Strength (RSSI)' - signal strength reported by Bluetooth gateway.
- Sensor 'Percentage by device' - percentage value reported directly from BM7 device.
- Sensor 'State by device' - battery state reported directly from BM7 device. Only 'Ok', 'Low Voltage' and 'Charging'.
- Sensor 'Bluetooth scanner' - name and address of Bluetooth scanner/gateway who interact with BM7 device

## Triggers

Triggers availability is depending on choose algorithm at configuration time. Their behavior corresponds to the change of the value 'State' sensor.

| Name                      | From BM7 | Calculated |
|---------------------------|:--------:|:----------:|
| Started OK state          |    X     |            |
| Started Low Voltage state |    X     |            |
| Under Voltage             |          |     X      |
| Started Discharging       |          |     X      |
| Started Idle              |          |     X      |
| Started Charging          |    X     |     X      |
| Over Voltage              |          |     X      |
| State Changed             |    X     |     X      |
